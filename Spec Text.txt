Define an interface, BarcodeIO, that contains these method signatures. 
Any class that implements BarcodeIO is expected to store some version of an 
image and some version of the text associated with that image.  I have 
described the purpose of the method signatures in the Modules, and I will rely 
on those descriptions so I don't have to repeat them here, or in the spec of 
DataMatrix later. 

public boolean scan(BarcodeImage bc);
public boolean readText(String text);
public boolean generateImageFromText();
public boolean translateImageToText();
public void displayTextToConsole();
public void displayImageToConsole();
