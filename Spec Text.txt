This class will realize all the essential data and methods associated with a 2D 
pattern, thought of conceptually as an image of a square or rectangular bar code.  
Here are the essential ingredients.  This class has very little "smarts" in it, 
except for the parameterized constructor.  It mostly just stores and retrieves 
2D data.

Remember: BarcodeImage implements Cloneable. (check)

DATA

public static final int MAX_HEIGHT = 30; (check)
public static final int MAX_WIDTH = 65; (check)
The exact internal dimensions of 2D data. 

private boolean[][] image_data (check) 
This is where to store your image. (check)
If the incoming data is too large, instantiate memory anyway,
but leave it blank (white). (check) 

This data will be false for elements that are white, and true for elements that 
are black.
   
METHODS

Constructors.  Two minimum, but you could have others:
Default Constructor -  instantiates a 2D array (MAX_HEIGHT x MAX_WIDTH) and 
stuffs it all with blanks (false). (check)

BarcodeImage(String[] str_data) -takes a 1D array of Strings and converts it to
 the internal 2D array of booleans. 
 
Accessor and mutator for each bit in the image: (check)
boolean getPixel(int row, int col) (check)
and boolean setPixel(int row, int col, boolean value); (check)

Optional - A private utility method is highly recommended, but not required:  
checkSize(String[] data)  It does the job of checking the incoming data for 
every conceivable size or null error.  Smaller is okay.  Bigger or null is not.
(check)

Optional - A displayToConsole() method that is useful for debugging this class,
 but not very useful for the assignment at large. (check, needs testing)
 
A clone() method that overrides the method of that name in Cloneable interface.
This is covered in detail in the modules. (check, needs testing)
